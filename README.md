Play music through Mycroft with Airplay

## About 
Once you install the skill, you can connect to it using any iOS or macOS device and play music through it!
The name of the speaker is the hostname of the computer.
The install takes a little while because it needs to build Shairport-sync. Once it is done installing, it will restart. If it doesn't restart, you'll need to restart it manually.
